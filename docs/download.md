## Linux builds

Linux binary distribution may not work out of the box, I highly recommend checking out the tutorials and compiling FineFramework from source. However, if you wish to download the pre-built binaries from github release, you will need to install the following dependencies: 

```
sudo apt-get install apt-get install xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
```

## Source Code

[Download as ZIP](https://github.com/matusnovak/fineframework/archive/master.zip) or as [TAR.GZ](https://github.com/matusnovak/fineframework/archive/master.tar.gz)

Use Git or checkout `https://github.com/matusnovak/fineframework.git`
